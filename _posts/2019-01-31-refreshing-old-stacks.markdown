It's obvious that refactoring or restructuring code too often is bad, and it's especially obvious that completely switching an application's core technology isn't ideal either - but sometimes it _is_ exactly what a stale project needs. When an app's tech gets old, obsecured and falls out of favour with developers, updating its source code can quickly become a challenge. The importance of staying current with tech trends is reasonably important for most companies, and is only compounded when a company sells SaaS that relies on core software written decades before CSS3, or real, full-featured JS engines, or a world without Internet Explorer's [Trident rendering engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(software)).  

But so is a complete rewrite - taking that old source code written in ASP.net and used by dozens of products across teams and servers is no small feat. As a result, sometimes it makes sense to break time-based tech paradigms and mix the paint a little. Just because you're running some archaic database system, or an ancient .NET backend doesn't mean the newest in front end tech is unattainable.
