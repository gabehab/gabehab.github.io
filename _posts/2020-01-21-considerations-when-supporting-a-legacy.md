Another year and another post about managing legacy web applications. 

My experience and work for the last year has involved getting heads down on countless projects, some brand new and others inherited after years in the works, and some using code created more than 10 years ago.
Now if you're familiar with how much the web development landscape has evolved in the last decade, you know supporting old applications were built in a different era. Flash still came with browsers, XML, SOAP and XHTML were things, and PHP 5.3 was still supported.
