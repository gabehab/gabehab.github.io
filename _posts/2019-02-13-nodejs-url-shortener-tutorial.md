A long while ago, many many moons before tonights, I built a [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) application that shortened URLs called [Lyt.Haus](https://lyt.haus). Conceptually, it's unoriginal - with hundreds, if not thousands of sites 
providing similar functionality. So why did I bother putting hours into it? Simply put, I wanted to be able to build a project that
had a realistic goal that could be accomplished individually, and actually be used by me (and anyone else) in need of shortening some URLs. 

Looking back, I think it was a great use of time and allowed me to have tangable experience with a full JS stack (MEEN, Mongo, Express, EJS*, Node)
