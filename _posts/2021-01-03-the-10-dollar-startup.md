##The mindset for a low cost startup

It's likely the dream of every founder (or really, just anyone that exists) to be successful. Especially founders and startups but, it's no secret that only a fraction turn out to be successful. The realities of the startup game are harsh - even with early and adequite funds, there's no such thing as a sure thing. Now obviously, I'm not saying there is no correlation between success and funding (i.e. it doesn't hurt to be flush with cash), but for those who aren't so lucky, what can we do? Simply put, keep your expenses proportional to your comfort with risk. For me, being frugal is part of my DNA, and I knew the odds of overcoming early startup death were against me. Hence, I've strived to reduce any financial burdens (without unnessecary technical limitations) while still setting myself up to break through the market.

##Smartly frugal, robustly useful
So we've covered the mindset going in to the startup world on a budget, but how do make something viable without breaking the bank? Well, the offering probably shouldn't be expensive to manufacture or provide. Succintly, it should probably be software - and something scalable. Next, there's no point saving money if it impededs the ability to sell/off a product/service. That's where experience comes in. Know when to build rather then buy, know when to embrace the simple as opposed to the new. Become an expert builder, a master tinkerer and a jack of all trades. Technology changes rapidly, SaaS becomes easy to use but expensive to keep. Antidotally, microservice architecture is all the rave right now, and generally requires the use of pay-per-instance services that offer easy to scale containers. It's pretty great when your in need of ultra scalable, high traffic systems. But guess what? It's expensive! A simple VPS (or collection of VPSs) can offer a robust and cheap alternative.
