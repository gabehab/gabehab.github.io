#Building a startup on 10 dollars a month

It's likely the dream of every founder (or really, just anyone that has a dream/idea/passion) to be successful. However, it's no secret that truly only a fraction of ideas turn out to be successful. The realities of the startup game are just as harsh - even with early and adequite funds. Now obviously, I'm not saying there is no correlation between success and funding (i.e. it doesn't hurt to be flush with cash), to be more succint, I did not have access to early capital, and I knew the odds of overcoming early startup death were against me. Hence, I've strived to reduce any cost and financial burdens to allow for max potential of breaking through the market.
