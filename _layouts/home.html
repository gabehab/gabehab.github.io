        <h4> Preamble </h4>
        <p> 
            This is a site dedicated to all things technology, and a little bit about me. If you've manage to stumble onto this treasure trove of randomness by accident or misfortune, 
            welcome! Please sit back and peruse at your leisure.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've had the fortune of working in the tech industry for the better part of the last decade. My journey started off earnestly, working as a co-op student at a small NGO in
            Toronto. It was there I dove head first into the web programming, which relatively new to me, considering my University courses focused on software development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't know what I wanted to do in terms of a career, or where I'd end up geographically, or even if I wanted to finish school. But ultimately, over the course of interships, co-op placements,
             part time, contract and full time work (and graduating), I've come to love building, creating and coding software, regardless of platform.

        <h4>  Present Day </h4>
        <p> 
            These days, I'm working at <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/"> UBC </a>, a world-renowned educational institution. It's here that I program solutions used by tens of thousands of 
            students and faculty, with a unique tech stack and an awesome team.
            Outside of of that, I also take part in a variety of my own projects and contracts. From working with companies across various industries 
            (&nbsp;<a href="https://customcare.ca"> Insurance </a>, <a href="https://vidyard.com"> SaaS </a>, <a href="https://nexthome.ca/">real estate </a>)
            to building my own <a href="https://lyt.haus">software</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally, I find the most rewarding jobs are challenging, diverse and look to solve something meaningful. If your organization is looking for a developer proficient with all things JS, Python,
            and more as team lead, contact me at via email.
